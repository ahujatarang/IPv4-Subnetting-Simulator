# IPv4 Subnetting Simulator 🌐

An interactive educational web application built using Django that helps users learn and practice IPv4 subnetting through simulations, theory guides, and tests. This project was developed as part of a networking-focused mini-project and received official copyright.

## 📌 Project Overview

This web-based simulator guides users through the process of IPv4 subnetting. It generates random IPs and subnet masks, asks users to classify and compute subnet values, and then evaluates their answers with step-by-step solutions.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🎯 Random IP generation with class and subnet calculation
- 📖 Integrated theory and learning section
- ✅ User input validation with immediate feedback
- 🧮 Simulation mode with guided steps and pre/post-tests
- 📝 Admin dashboard for reviewing attempts and performance
- 🛡️ Copyright protected

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## 🧾 Code Snippets

Due to copyright constraints and academic policy, the complete project codebase is not publicly available.

However, the repository includes representative and functional core components that demonstrate the project logic and simulation flow:
- `views.py` – Handles backend logic for generating random IPs, subnetting calculations, and rendering results
- `ip-addressing.py` – Core class to determine IP class, subnet count, host count, and subnet mask
- `sim1.html` – Main simulation interface allowing user interaction and validation logic (HTML + JS)
These files are available under the Code Snippets/ folder to give a clear understanding of how the application works.
